In modern cloud-native environments, security must be embedded from code to runtime.  

Key practices:  
- Policy as Code (OPA, Kyverno)  
- CI/CD Security: static analysis, dependency scanning, container image checks  
- Runtime security: RBAC, network policies, Falco  

Zero Trust principles and observability ensure secure, scalable, and resilient systems.
